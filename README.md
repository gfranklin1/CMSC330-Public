# CMSC330 - Organization of Programming Languages

Welcome to my repository for ```CMSC330 - Organization of Programming Languages``` at the ```University of Maryland, College Park```. This repository includes a summary and the grade received for the projects that I completed throughout this course. Due to university policies, the code for these projects is not publicly available. If you are an employer or have a legitimate request to view the code, please contact me directly.

## Projects 

### Project 1: **Ocaml Warmup**
**Description:**  
- Implemented recursive and higher-order functions in OCaml.
- Designed list manipulation algorithms (`reverse`, `merge`, `zip`, `every_nth`).
- Created numeric functions (`fibonacci`, `power`, `logarithm`, `GCD`).
- Used fold to implement higher-order functions, including uniqueness filtering and element counting (`there_is`, `count_occ`, `uniq`, `every_xth`).
- Used functional programming principles (immutability, recursion, no imperative structures).

**Grade:** 100/100
